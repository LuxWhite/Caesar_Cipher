Caesar Cipher / Shit Cipher:

named after "Julius Caesar"
- this is one of the earliest and simplest method of encryption.
- A type of substitution cipher.

- Substitutions ->    Exchanging each character of the text message with another
   (Monoalphabetic)   character or symbol.

How its used / done?:
A shift is used, so each letter of the given text is substituted with a letter of a fixed number of
positions down the alphabet.
eg. with a shift of 3, A would be replaced with D, and B would be replaced
with E.

Algorithm:
The Caesar Cipher can be expressed in a more mathematical form as follows:
En(x) = (x+n) mod 26

The encryption of letter "x" is equal to the shift of (x + n),
"n" being the number of letters shifted.
We MOD 26 simply to keep it between the ranges of 0 - 25 (Letters of the Alphabet index).

A string of letters variable name "text".
integer between 0-25 representing the required shift.

Procedure / Method:
Step (1) Traverse the "text" one character at a time.
Step (2) For each of the character, sub the character based on Caesar Cipher rule.
Step (3) Return the new string generated.
